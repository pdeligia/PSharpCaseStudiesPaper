We presented a new methodology for testing distributed systems. Our approach involves using \psharp, an extension of the \csharp language that provides advanced modeling, specification and systematic testing capabilities. We reported experience on applying \psharp on three distributed storage systems that are used inside Microsoft. Using \psharp, the developers of these systems found, reproduced, confirmed and fixed numerous bugs.
