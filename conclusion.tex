We presented a new approach for testing distributed systems in production. This approach involves using \psharp a systematic testing framework for asynchronous systems. We reported experience on applying \psharp on three case studies inside Microsoft. Using \psharp we found, reproduced and fixed numerous bugs in these case studies.
