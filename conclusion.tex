We presented a new methodology for testing distributed storage systems. Our approach involves using \psharp, an extension of the \csharp language that provides advanced modeling, specification and systematic testing capabilities. We reported experience on applying our methodology on three distributed storage systems used in production inside Microsoft. Using \psharp we found, reproduced and fixed numerous bugs in these case studies.
