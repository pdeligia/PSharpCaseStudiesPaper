Various notes about the project / build setup:

The Migration project currently uses its own solution file because the Kiwi
solution fails to build on my machine and I have neither the knowledge nor the
inclination to fix it right now.  But Migration.sln is in the same directory as
Kiwi.sln so it can share the NuGet package cache.

The project file and scripts assume that you have a built PSharp working tree
alongside the Kiwi working tree.  You can change this if desired.

NOTE: I'm currently assuming the use of my modified version of PSharp from
https://mattmccutchen-ms.visualstudio.com/DefaultCollection/_git/PSharp, branch
for-verification.  The main issue is the modification to the scheduler to not be
confused by intra-machine tasks.  Eventually it should be possible to port the
verification framework to the official P# async support.

PSharpCompiler by itself does not download NuGet packages or copy external
assemblies to the output directory (the latter is
https://github.com/p-org/PSharp/issues/11).  The easiest workaround is to build
once with Visual Studio and then recompile or test with P#, letting it overwrite
a subset of the files in the output directory.
