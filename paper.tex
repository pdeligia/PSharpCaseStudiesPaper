% TEMPLATE for Usenix papers, specifically to meet requirements of

% originally a template for producing IEEE-format articles using LaTeX.
%   written by Matthew Ward, CS Department, Worcester Polytechnic Institute.
% adapted by David Beazley for his excellent SWIG paper in Proceedings,

% turned into a smartass generic template by De Clarke, with thanks to

% use at your own risk.  Complaints to /dev/null.
% make it two column with no page numbering, default is 10 point

% Munged by Fred Douglis <douglis@research.att.com> 10/97 to separate
% the .sty file from the LaTeX source template, so that people can
% more easily include the .sty file into an existing document.  Also
% changed to more closely follow the style guidelines as represented
% by the Word sample file. 

% Note that since 2010, USENIX does not require endnotes. If you want
% foot of page notes, don't include the endnotes package in the 
% usepackage command, below.

% This version uses the latex2e styles, not the very ancient 2.09 stuff.

\subsection*{Abstract}
Testing distributed systems is very challenging due to multiple sources of nondeterminism, such as arbitrary interleavings between event handlers and unexpected node failures. Stress testing, commonly used in industry today, is unable to deal with this kind of nondeterminism, which results in the most tricky bugs being missed during testing and only getting exposed in production.

We discuss our experience of using \psharp inside Microsoft to test three distributed storage systems for the Windows Azure cloud computing platform. \psharp is an extension of the \csharp language that provides environmental modeling capabilities and a systematic concurrency testing engine. As long as the developer has expressed all sources of nondeterminism in a system using \psharp, then the \psharp testing engine can systematically explore all these sources of nondeterminism to find bugs.

The power of \psharp is that it enables the developer to \emph{test what is being executed} and is engineered to work on production-level code. Using \psharp we managed to find and reproduce more than 10 hard-to-find with traditional testing techniques bugs in our case studies. As an example, \psharp found a very subtle bug that was haunting developers for a long time, as they did not have an effective way to reproduce it. \psharp uncovered the bug in a very small setting, which made it easy to examine traces, identify and fix the problem.
