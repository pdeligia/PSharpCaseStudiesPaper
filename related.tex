A significant amount of research has been conducted on how to analyze and test distributed systems~\cite{lamport1994temporal, schuppan2004efficient, killian2007life, gupta2008diecast, yang2009modist}, but a lot of these techniques either have significant limitations, or cannot be easily applied in a production environment, due to many complexities that are outside the scope of a research project.
