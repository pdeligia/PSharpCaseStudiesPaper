A significant amount of research has been conducted on how to analyze and test distributed systems~\cite{lamport1994temporal, schuppan2004efficient, killian2007life, gupta2008diecast, yang2009modist}, but a lot of these techniques either have significant limitations, or cannot be easily applied in a production environment, due to many complexities that are outside the scope of a research project.

In Verdi~\cite{wilcox2015verdi}, a distributed system is written and verified in Coq, and then OCaml code is produced for execution. Verdi cannot find liveness bugs. \psharp is also more production-friendly (works on a mainstream language). \PDComment{say few more stuff}

D3S~\cite{liu2008d3s} \PDComment{should read the paper, they say they are debugging running systems}
